# Who am I?

Hello! My name is Judicael. I'm a self-taught cybersecurity enthusiast, focusing mainly on Windows internals. I have a strong interest in red teaming and malware analysis, and I plan to make my blog lean more toward these subjects. If you have any suggestions or just want to say hello, feel free to email me at `0xgaze.blog@proton.me`.
