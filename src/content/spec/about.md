# About
Hello, my name is Judicael. I'm a Windows Internals enthusiast and self-taught. Cybersecurity is my passion, and right now I'm focusing on userland Windows Internals. I write articles on what I learn along the way to share my knowledge. Later, I will expand to more subjects, like reverse engineering, as I become more comfortable, and eventually the kernel.
